# devtomanager.com-DataScraping
In this Repository I have shared Jupyter  notebook file by which I scraped the data from 'devtomanager' site where I have scraped the data like name of applicant, his/her designation, his/her  name of currently working firm, his/ her Interview Quotes, the date of application and tags associated with them, I is a tricky site to scrape data, as there are lots of div and multiple sibling tags parent tags, also the name of applicant his/her designation and currently working firm is mentioned in a single line without any separate title. So I used string slicing, list comprehension and many more methods to scrape data from this site. At the end I also made functions to fully automate the process and scraped the data from 5 pages. I am also sharing the .csv file that I created at the end.
